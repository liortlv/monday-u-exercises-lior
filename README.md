## Instructions:

- In this app you can add to-dos.
- Try to type in a number or a Pokemon name (4 for Charmander for example, or just "charmander").
- You can type few pokemons id's to catch multiple Pokemons by comma seperating them (1,2,3 for example).
- You can sort by name, search and sort by done/undone.
- And of course, you can delete each task by hovering it and clicking the trash button.
